"""
Wave_position class helps to time a tack manoeuvre. It inputs vertical acceleration and predicts ship
position on the wave so that tack manoevre can be started at the crest when it is most convenient.

Usage:
wp = Wave_position(frequency, time_range, refresh_time) # to initialize
# Every time new reading is obtain, call
wp.update(new_reading) # where new_reading is vertical acceleration
# Call
wp.get_position()
# to get predicted position on the wave. Returns a number between 0 and 1 which is a relative distance
# from the last crest. (at the crest it is 0, at the trough 0.5, just before the next crest 1 and just after
# the crest 0 again). Be aware that during first time_range seconds after first call of update method,
# initialisation is enabled and get_positon() returns "initializing"

Code explanation:
After get_positon is called for the first time, initialisation phase is enabled for the time specified by time_range.
Every time update method is called, new reading is appended to a queue. If get_position is called now, it returns
"initializing". After time_range seconds pass, initializing phase is disabled. Every time update method is called
now, it appends new element to the queue and removes the oldest one to keep the size of the queue constant. Data from
the queue are coppied to ydata variable every time update is called and time from the last update is larger
then refresh_time. When this happens, xdata are generated based on the frequency and number of items in ydata.
Next sine function is fitted to xdata, ydata. Prediction of the position on the wave is made based on this sine
function and time that has passed from the last refresh.
